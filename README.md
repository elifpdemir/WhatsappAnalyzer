This Java project analyzes a WhatsApp chat exported as a `.txt` file. It calculates how many days two people communicated within a given date range and identifies who initiated the conversation on each day.

## Features

- âœ… Takes two dates as input and calculates how many days apart they are
- âœ… Counts how many days messages were exchanged between the selected dates
- âœ… Identifies which person initiated the conversation on each day
- âœ… Displays how many times each person started a conversation
- âœ… Supports messages exported from WhatsApp in `.txt` format

## Technologies Used

- Java
- File reading (`BufferedReader`)
- Regular expressions
- Date handling (`LocalDate`, `DateTimeFormatter`)

## Example Input Format

Make sure your `.txt` file looks like this (WhatsApp default export):



## How to Use

1. Export a WhatsApp chat as a `.txt` file.
2. Place the file in the `src` folder of this project.
3. Run the program and enter:
   - The full file name (e.g., `chat.txt`)
   - The name of the other person in the conversation (e.g., `Bob`)
   - Start and end dates for analysis (e.g., `27.02.2025` to `05.03.2025`)
4. The program will display:
   - Total days between given dates
   - Number of days messages were exchanged
   - Who started the conversation each day
   - Total number of conversation initiations by each participant

## Project Purpose

This project was developed to reinforce understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP), file I/O, and date manipulation in Java. The goal was to create something useful, clear, and practical for real-world data analysis.

## Sample Chat File

Check out the example chat file in the `src` folder:  
ðŸ“„ [`example-messages.txt`](src/example-messages.txt)
